My name is Peter Brooksbank. I'm a software developer. I blog about things that interest me. It's early days for this blog but I hope to have a diverse array of topics in the future.

### 2013

In 2013 I graduated from the University of Hull with a Master of Engineering in Computer Science. I had an enjoyable 4 years and took part in multiple opportunities for 24hr team game jams which were always a great time. In my masters year I worked within the departments in-house software company SEED. My team developed the ACTV System, a means of tracking Fire Service assets and visualising the coverage provided by those assets via real-time coverage maps and hypothetical scenarios.

After graduating I moved to York to begin my career at PureNet. During the next 3 and a half years I would help build and deliver multiple B2C & B2B ecommerce sites and portals across a wide variety of verticals, ranging from energy markets to subscriptions to industrial tooling. 

I worked on all levels of the projects, including:

* SQL Server
* .Net backend
* HTML, CSS and Javascript frameworks on the frontend
